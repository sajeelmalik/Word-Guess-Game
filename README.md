# Code Snippets
<!-- put snippets of code inside ``` ``` so it will look like code -->
<!-- if you want to put blockquotes use a > -->

Javascript enables the developer to instatiate functions that rely on a user's input, namely when they press certain keys on the keyboard. Psychic Game's crucial logic runs on an event-specific function *only* when a user's inputted key hase been released (document.onkeyup).

# Learning points
<!-- Learning points where you would write what you thought was helpful -->
* object-driven functions drastically simplify game code and allow for more robust applications. There is still much, much more to learn in this space, especially in optimizing and cleaning up written code
